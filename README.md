# Terraform module of  AWS - Lambda function - Just for learn purpose!!! 

All terraform modules from my repositories is only for learn purpose, so it can be broken, incomplete or not working well!

So if you use that code be careful and you will be at your own!!! Good lucky!!!

# What is an Lambda Function?
Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that Lambda supports.

# Motivation
I wrote a lot of codes using terraform modules and for each individual project I had to replicated the modules.

Therefore as terraform accept to work with remote repositories I decided to use github as my source of terraform modules.

# About the project
This project just store the common git files (license and readme.md) and terraform files (main, var and output).
